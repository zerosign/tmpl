# tmpl

lexer, parser library for tmpl template language

jinja like template but not a jinja.

A lexer is a software program that performs lexical analysis.
Lexical analysis is the process of separating a stream of characters
into different words, which in computer science we call 'tokens' .

A parser goes one level further than the lexer and takes the tokens
produced by the lexer and tries to determine if proper sentences have been formed.
Parsers work at the grammatical level, lexers work at the word level.
